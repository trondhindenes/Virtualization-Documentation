# Kubernetes on Windows #
With the latest release of Kubernetes 1.9 and Windows Server [version 1709](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/whats-new-in-windows-server-1709#networking), users can take advantage of the latest features in Windows networking:

  - **shared pod compartments**: infrastructure and worker pods now share a network compartment (analagous to a Linux namespace)
  - **endpoint optimization**: thanks to compartment sharing, container services need to track (at least) half as many endpoints as before
  - **data-path optimization**: improvements to the Virtual Filtering Platform and the Host Networking Service allow kernel-based load-balancing


This page serves as a guide for getting started joining a brand new Windows node to an existing Linux-based cluster. To start completely from scratch, refer to [this page](./creating-a-linux-master.md) &mdash; one of many resources available for deploying a Kubernetes cluster &mdash; to set a master up from scratch the same way we did.


<a name="definitions"></a>
These are definitions for some terms that are referenced throughout this guide:

  - The **external network** is the network across which your nodes communicate.
  - <a name="cluster-subnet-def"></a>The **cluster subnet** is a routable virtual network; nodes are assigned smaller subnets from this for their pods to use.
  - The **service subnet** is a non-routable, purely virtual subnet on 11.0/16 that is used by pods to uniformally access services without caring about the network topology. It is translated to/from routable address space by `kube-proxy` running on the nodes.


## What We Will Accomplish ##
By the end of this guide, we will have:

> [!div class="checklist"]  
> * Prepared our [network topology](#network-topology).  
> * Configured a [Linux master](#preparing-the-linux-master) node.  
> * Joined a [Windows worker node](#preparing-a-windows-node) to it.  
> * Deployed a [sample Windows service](#running-a-sample-service).  
> * Covered [common problems and mistakes](./common-problems.md).  


## Network Topology ##
There are multiple ways to make the virtual [cluster subnet](#cluster-subnet-def) routable. You can:

  - Configure [host-gateway mode](./configuring-host-gateway-mode.md), setting static next-hop routes between nodes to enable pod-to-pod communication.
  - Configure a smart top-of-rack (ToR) switch to route the subnet.
  - Use a 3rd-party overlay plugin such as [Flannel](https://coreos.com/flannel/docs/latest/kubernetes.html) (Windows support for Flannel is in development).


## Preparing the Linux Master ##
Regardless of whether you followed [our instructions](./creating-a-linux-master.md) or already have an existing cluster, only one thing is needed from the Linux master is Kubernetes' certificate configuration. This could be in `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`, `~/.kube/config`, or elsewhere depending on your setup.


## Preparing a Windows Node ##
> [!Note]  
> All code snippets in Windows sections are to be run in elevated PowerShell.

Kubernetes uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as its container orchestrator, so we need to install it. You can follow the [official MSDN instructions](virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/configure-docker-daemon.md#install-docker), the [Docker instructions](https://store.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-server-windows), or try these steps:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name DockerMsftProvider -Repository PSGallery -Force
Install-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
Restart-Computer -Force
```

There is a collection of scripts on [this Microsoft repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/SDN) that will help us join this node to the cluster. You can download the ZIP file directly [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/SDN/archive/master.zip). The only thing we need is the `Kubernetes/windows` folder, the contents of which should be moved to `C:\k\`:

```powershell
wget https://github.com/Microsoft/SDN/archive/master.zip -o master.zip
Expand-Archive master.zip -DestinationPath master
mkdir C:/k/
mv master/SDN-master/Kubernetes/windows/* C:/k/
rm -recurse -force master,master.zip
```

Copy the certificate file [identified earlier](#preparing-the-linux-master) to this new `C:\k` directory.


### Creating the "Pause" Image ###
Now that `docker` is installed, we need to prepare a "pause" image that's used by Kubernetes to prepare the infrastructure pods.

```powershell
docker pull microsoft/windowsservercore:1709
docker tag $(docker images -q) microsoft/windowsservercore:latest
cd C:/k/
docker build -t kubeletwin/pause .
```

> [!Note]  
> We tag it as the `:latest` because that's what is expected by the sample service we will be deploying later.


### Downloading Binaries ###
In the meantime while the `pull` occurs, download the following client-side binaries from Kubernetes:

  - `kubectl.exe`
  - `kubelet.exe`
  - `kube-proxy.exe`

You can download these from the links in the `CHANGELOG.md` file of the latest 1.9 release. As of this writing, that is [1.9.0-beta.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.9.0-beta.1), and the Windows binaries are [here](https://dl.k8s.io/v1.9.0-beta.1/kubernetes-node-windows-amd64.tar.gz). Use a tool like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the archive and place the binaries in `C:\k\`.

> [!Warning]  
> As of this writing, `kube-proxy.exe` requires a pending Kubernetes [pull request](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/56529) to work properly. You may need to [build the binaries manually](./compiling-kubernetes-binaries.md) to work around this.


### Joining the Cluster ###
The node is now ready to join the cluster. In two separate, *elevated* PowerShell windows, run these scripts (in this order). The `-ClusterCidr` parameter in the first script is the configured [cluster subnet](#cluster-subnet-def); here, it's `192.168.0.0/16`.

```powershell
./start-kubelet.ps1 -ClusterCidr 192.168.0.0/16
./start-kubeproxy.ps1
```

The Windows node will be visible from the Linux master under `kubectl get nodes` within a minute!


### Validating Your Network Topology ###
There are a few basic tests that will validate a proper network configuration:

  - **Node to node connectivity**: pings between master and Windows worker nodes should succeed in both directions.

  - **Pod subnet to node connectivity**: pings between the virtual pod interface and the nodes. Find the gateway address under `route -n` and `ipconfig` on Linux and Windows, respectively, looking for the `cbr0` interface.

If any of these basic tests don't work, try the [troubleshooting page](./common-problems.md#network-connectivity) to solve common issues.


## Running a Sample Service ##
We'll be deploying a very simple [PowerShell-based web service](https://github.com/Microsoft/SDN/blob/master/Kubernetes/WebServer.yaml) to ensure we joined the cluster successfully and our network is properly configured.


On the Linux master, download and run the service:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/SDN/master/Kubernetes/WebServer.yaml -O win-webserver.yaml
kubectl apply -f win-webserver.yaml
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```

This will create a deployment and a service, then watch the pods indefinitely to track their status; simply press `Ctrl+C` to exit the `watch` command when done observing.


If all went well, you will be able to validate that it's possible to:

  - see 4 containers under a `docker ps` command on the Windows side
  - `curl` on the *pod* IPs on port 80 from the Linux master gets a web server response; this demonstrates proper node to pod communication across the network.
  - `curl` on the *node* IP on port 4444 gets a web server response; this demonstrates proper host-to-container port mapping.
  - ping *between pods* (including across hosts, if you have more than one Windows node) via `docker exec`; this demonstrates proper pod-to-pod communication
  - `curl` the virtual *service IP* (seen under `kubectl get services`) from the Linux master and from individual pods.
  - `curl` the *service name* with the Kubernetes [default DNS suffix](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#services), demonstrating DNS functionality.

> [!Warning]  
> Windows nodes will not be able to access the service IP. This is a [known limitation](./common-problems.md#common-windows-errors).
